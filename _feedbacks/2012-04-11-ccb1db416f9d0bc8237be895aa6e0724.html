    New specific biological product to remedy autoimmunereactions of a streptococcal
    aetiology.V.A.Esepenok, the Doctor of Veterinary Science. MoscowState Academy
    of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnology named after Dr K.I. Skryabin.Streptococcoci
    is an infectious disease of humanbeings, of all types of live-stock animals, wildlife
    fauna, laboratory animalsas well as of all barnyard and wildlife fowls, bees,
    fish and the reptiles,which is induced by gram-positive bacteria of streptococcosus.
    Wide bacteriacarriage rate among attendants and service personnel fosters the
    infection ofanimals and vice versa, due to the fact that haemolytic streptococci
    areidentical for all the chordates.The disease affects localized sectors (abscess),
    specifictissues, organs, body systems as well as all the organism leading to a
    lethaltermination.Pathogenic streptococci are complex biological substanceswith
    external and internal enzymes which in the course of their biological lifehave
    adapted to elude from phagocytes, to avoid system of complement, to form mutantsin
    a parent cell causing disease of the host even when there are no signs ofimmunodeficiency.The
    aetiological significance of streptococci in pathologyof animals and human beings
    is being underestimated, as they are fastidious tonutrient mediums and certain
    skills for their extraction from pathologicalmaterial are required. Immune attack
    of autogenous tissues of the host of thepathogenic agent germinates usually without
    its excretion from the diseasedorganism. Internal aggressines of pathogenic streptococci
    damage tissues of thehost and ensure penetration of streptococci (disease progress
    i.e. zymosis) aswell as of other microorganisms, i.e. provoking a number of infectious
    diseaseswhich are not listed in R. Koch's triad.Having studied the biology of
    pathogenic streptococciand disease progress during their penetration into a susceptible
    organism, wehave prepared a toxoid-vaccine STREPTOEVAK on the basis of biological
    polymers(1).The biological product in reference is harmless and arectogenious,possesses
    antitoxic and preventive effects against haemolytic streptococci ofanimals and
    birds. The above has been proved in experimental and workingconditions on thousands
    various kinds of susceptible animals (2).At present practicing medical experts
    all over the worldhave nor secure tools nor preventive remedy for streptococcosis
    of humanbeings. According to L.V.Lvova (2000)(3), in case of streptococcosis disease,
    unfortunately, there is no medicalproduct able to save human beings from glomerulonephritis.
    Even such radicaltreatment as transplantation does not ensure success for up to
    100%, because inmost of the cases glomerulonephritis germinates again in the replaced
    kidney. Scientistsof the State Centre of Science of Virology and Biotechnology
    of the RussianFederation called the VECTOR (2006) have put forward a hypothesis:
    «Aetiology of oncological and cardiovascular diseases » where theyconvincingly
    predict etiological significance of streptococci. We theoreticallyunderstand and
    support medical scientists, and practically we are working for confirminga solvency
    of their assumptions.Autoimmune diseases of eyesight constitute a seriousproblem
    of veterinary medicine due to the fact that it is often that suchdiseases lead
    to dangerous, and sometimes even irreversible changes in eyetissue. The keratoconjunctivitis
    sicca (when the inflammation is dueto dryness), which leads,as its consequence,
    to the deep parenchymatous ulcerous keratitis with ulcersthat remain unhealed
    for rather extended period of time constitute a seriousproblem because apart from
    representing some interrelated processes they are alsothe linking components of
    pathogenesis thus provoking the blindness of animals.The toxoid-vaccine of STREPTOEVAK
    is successfully applied to the treatment ofcats with an initial stage of corneal
    sequestrum. The basic diagnostic criteriafor this product application are: blepharospasmus,
    lachrymation, third eyelidprolapse. When applying the solution offluorescein against
    the affected cornea an intensive green coloring of all erosivesurface appears.
    Streptoevak is normally applied in a dose of 0.5 mlintramuscularly with an interval
    of 15-20 days up to three applications. Together with Streptoevak the Actovegin
    isnormally prescribed which is an eye jelly, as well as some antimicrobial agents.When
    the treatment starts without delay a restoration of integrity of the corneais
    achieved, and further impregnation of the denuded stroma with epinephrine oftear
    does not occur as well as pigmentary focus formation is being avoided .Especially
    this biological product is effective (thatproves its high specificity) in the
    cases of transformation of fibroblast-likecells on mucous tunic of eyes of dogs
    (the third eyesight). Enclosed photos show animals before treatment(1.2) and those
    after treatment (3.4). The course of treatment is just four (4)injections in accordance
    with instructions for application of toxiod-vaccine product.For the first time
    in the world the results of treatment of cats and dogs curingstreptococcosus disease
    aftereffects have been achieved without surgeryoperations.Studying the influence
    of STREPTOEVAK over the growthof an intertwined liver tumor (hepatocellular carcinoma)
    of mice was our next stageof work. The experiment has been made onmice RUVR. For
    the hypodermic transplantation ithas been used the passage number 16 of the liver
    tumor strain on experiment animals,which was obtained in Russian Oncological Scientific
    Center named afterN.N.Blokhin working under the RussianAcademy of Medical Science.
    The mice have been vaccinated twice with aninterval of 12 days by intraperitoneal
    introduction in doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mlrespectively. Transplant subinoculationof
    the tumor has been made after 7 days following the last vaccination. Thecontrol
    of effects has been made comparing the results against non-vaccinatedmice having
    subinoculated tumors. Effects of vaccination have been evaluated bythe periods
    between the first tumor nodes occur and tumor nodes in progress ata later stage
    as well as when the tumor growth slows down and finallyevaluating the changes
    in life expectancy. The first nodes in the vaccinatedtissue of vaccinated mice
    have appeared a little bit later (the percentage oftime increase was equal to
    5%), however, the difference between the experimentgroup and the control one were
    not very significant from statistics point ofview. The average volume of tumor
    nodes among the vaccinated mice was less,than among non-vaccinated mice. Significant
    differences were registered in 8 outof 11 measurements made during the experiment.
    Among the vaccinated mice some decrease inaverage life expectancy (8 %) has been
    registered, however, the differences inreference were not significant from statistics
    point of view as compared with non-vaccinated animalsresults.Analyzing the received
    positive results on cats anddogs (more than 100 animals), and also on laboratory
    animals it is possible to makea confident conclusion that toxoid-vaccine STREPTOEVAK

    [Comment] =&gt; Hello !<br />
 I'm the author of toxoid vaccine<br />
"STREPTOEVAK" designed for animal and bird prophylactics against<br />
streptococcal infection and its complications. This biological product is<br />
used to treat sick animals as well as infection prevention. This vaccine is<br />
unique; there is no analogue of this vaccine in the world. The directions of<br />
the use of toxoid vaccine "STREPTOEVAK" were approved on 05.03.2004 by the<br />
Chief Veterinary Department. The vaccine has been used successfully in a<br />
number of animal breeding farms across Russia.<br />
The composition of the biological product is Streptococcus zoepidemicus.</p>
<p>All males and females are vaccinated 20-30 days before mating in order to<br />
treat the latent form of the disease as well as provision of prophylactics<br />
of spontaneous abortion, resorption of foetuses, premature labor, mastitis,<br />
endometritis and umbilical sepsis. Cows and mares are vaccinated 10-15 days<br />
before giving birth.<br />
Young animals are vaccinated 10 -15 days prior to the end of weaning as a<br />
way of prophylactics of arthritis, glomerulonephritis, psoriasis, and<br />
cancer.The main idea, make a similar  toxoid  vaccine (strep. A,B) for  treat and profhilactic for  humans against streptococcic and complications:abortion,stillborn,disablement of  new-born,sepsis,pneumonia,mastitis,menigites,rheumatism, rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis, psoriasis and cancer</p>

 New specific biological product to remedy autoimmunereactions of a streptococcal aetiology.V.A.Esepenok, the Doctor of Veterinary Science. MoscowState Academy of Veterinary Medicine and Biotechnology named after Dr K.I. Skryabin.Streptococcoci is an infectious disease of humanbeings, of all types of live-stock animals, wildlife fauna, laboratory animalsas well as of all barnyard and wildlife fowls, bees, fish and the reptiles,which is induced by gram-positive bacteria of streptococcosus. Wide bacteriacarriage rate among attendants and service personnel fosters the infection ofanimals and vice versa, due to the fact that haemolytic streptococci areidentical for all the chordates.The disease affects localized sectors (abscess), specifictissues, organs, body systems as well as all the organism leading to a lethaltermination.Pathogenic streptococci are complex biological substanceswith external and internal enzymes which in the course of their biological lifehave adapted to elude from phagocytes, to avoid system of complement, to form mutantsin a parent cell causing disease of the host even when there are no signs ofimmunodeficiency.The aetiological significance of streptococci in pathologyof animals and human beings is being underestimated, as they are fastidious tonutrient mediums and certain skills for their extraction from pathologicalmaterial are required. Immune attack of autogenous tissues of the host of thepathogenic agent germinates usually without its excretion from the diseasedorganism. Internal aggressines of pathogenic streptococci damage tissues of thehost and ensure penetration of streptococci (disease progress i.e. zymosis) aswell as of other microorganisms, i.e. provoking a number of infectious diseaseswhich are not listed in R. Koch's triad.Having studied the biology of pathogenic streptococciand disease progress during their penetration into a susceptible organism, wehave prepared a toxoid-vaccine STREPTOEVAK on the basis of biological polymers(1).The biological product in reference is harmless and arectogenious,possesses antitoxic and preventive effects against haemolytic streptococci ofanimals and birds. The above has been proved in experimental and workingconditions on thousands various kinds of susceptible animals (2).At present practicing medical experts all over the worldhave nor secure tools nor preventive remedy for streptococcosis of humanbeings. According to L.V.Lvova (2000)(3), in case of streptococcosis disease, unfortunately, there is no medicalproduct able to save human beings from glomerulonephritis. Even such radicaltreatment as transplantation does not ensure success for up to 100%, because inmost of the cases glomerulonephritis germinates again in the replaced kidney. Scientistsof the State Centre of Science of Virology and Biotechnology of the RussianFederation called the VECTOR (2006) have put forward a hypothesis: «Aetiology of oncological and cardiovascular diseases » where theyconvincingly predict etiological significance of streptococci. We theoreticallyunderstand and support medical scientists, and practically we are working for confirminga solvency of their assumptions.Autoimmune diseases of eyesight constitute a seriousproblem of veterinary medicine due to the fact that it is often that suchdiseases lead to dangerous, and sometimes even irreversible changes in eyetissue. The keratoconjunctivitis sicca (when the inflammation is dueto dryness), which leads,as its consequence, to the deep parenchymatous ulcerous keratitis with ulcersthat remain unhealed for rather extended period of time constitute a seriousproblem because apart from representing some interrelated processes they are alsothe linking components of pathogenesis thus provoking the blindness of animals.The toxoid-vaccine of STREPTOEVAK is successfully applied to the treatment ofcats with an initial stage of corneal sequestrum. The basic diagnostic criteriafor this product application are: blepharospasmus, lachrymation, third eyelidprolapse. When applying the solution offluorescein against the affected cornea an intensive green coloring of all erosivesurface appears. Streptoevak is normally applied in a dose of 0.5 mlintramuscularly with an interval of 15-20 days up to three applications. Together with Streptoevak the Actovegin isnormally prescribed which is an eye jelly, as well as some antimicrobial agents.When the treatment starts without delay a restoration of integrity of the corneais achieved, and further impregnation of the denuded stroma with epinephrine oftear does not occur as well as pigmentary focus formation is being avoided .Especially this biological product is effective (thatproves its high specificity) in the cases of transformation of fibroblast-likecells on mucous tunic of eyes of dogs (the third eyesight). Enclosed photos show animals before treatment(1.2) and those after treatment (3.4). The course of treatment is just four (4)injections in accordance with instructions for application of toxiod-vaccine product.For the first time in the world the results of treatment of cats and dogs curingstreptococcosus disease aftereffects have been achieved without surgeryoperations.Studying the influence of STREPTOEVAK over the growthof an intertwined liver tumor (hepatocellular carcinoma) of mice was our next stageof work. The experiment has been made onmice RUVR. For the hypodermic transplantation ithas been used the passage number 16 of the liver tumor strain on experiment animals,which was obtained in Russian Oncological Scientific Center named afterN.N.Blokhin working under the RussianAcademy of Medical Science. The mice have been vaccinated twice with aninterval of 12 days by intraperitoneal introduction in doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mlrespectively. Transplant subinoculationof the tumor has been made after 7 days following the last vaccination. Thecontrol of effects has been made comparing the results against non-vaccinatedmice having subinoculated tumors. Effects of vaccination have been evaluated bythe periods between the first tumor nodes occur and tumor nodes in progress ata later stage as well as when the tumor growth slows down and finallyevaluating the changes in life expectancy. The first nodes in the vaccinatedtissue of vaccinated mice have appeared a little bit later (the percentage oftime increase was equal to 5%), however, the difference between the experimentgroup and the control one were not very significant from statistics point ofview. The average volume of tumor nodes among the vaccinated mice was less,than among non-vaccinated mice. Significant differences were registered in 8 outof 11 measurements made during the experiment. Among the vaccinated mice some decrease inaverage life expectancy (8 %) has been registered, however, the differences inreference were not significant from statistics point of view as compared with non-vaccinated animalsresults.Analyzing the received positive results on cats anddogs (more than 100 animals), and also on laboratory animals it is possible to makea confident conclusion that toxoid-vaccine STREPTOEVAK is a specific medicalbiological product which enables to achievethe required effects in cases of autoimmune reactions of streptococcalaetiology.1.
