<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I heard that PLoS Currents, although non peer-reviewed, are about to move from Knol to Annotum. Is it true? </p>
<p>The peer-reviewed journal I will work soon with, Symplectic Biology (related to Synthetic Biology; http://www.symplecticbiology.org/), is using the Knol interface but this is not practical nor effective. </p>
<p>My questions: Do you think that Annotum could be a good option? How is the interface in terms of accessibility to reviewers not familiarized with open access? It will be great if someone could help me please!</p>
