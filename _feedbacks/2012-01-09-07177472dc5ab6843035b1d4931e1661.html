    Sirs  \r\n\r\nSubject: Would you be able to kindly help us?\r\n\r\nWe’re looking
    for a highly experienced web development company with design and extensive back-end
    coding skills onboard that would be willing to support the development of our
    platform, free of charge.\r\n\r\nNot much then! \r\n\r\nChampions Club Community
    is an organisation dedicated to helping all people recognise and fulfil their
    potential, irrespective or where or how they started out in \r\nlife – being the
    difference\r\n\r\nIt’s an amazing story – over 107 people so far have come together
    as volunteers, to give of their skills and talents to help others. No one is being
    paid directly to do this, but there is a share scheme in place to reward people’s
    contribution. You can read more about us at; \r\n\r\nhttp://championsclubcommunity.com/my-community/files/2011/12/People-Proof-11.pdf
    \r\nWe’re building a global life improvement / personal development platform for
    the benefit of others, framed around Abraham Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs (from
    the basic requirements of food and shelter through to self-actualisation).\r\n\r\nA
    key part of this is what we are calling “The Global Noticeboard”, whereby those
    able to give, (e.g. food, clothes, money, computers, books, skills, coaching,
    mentoring etc), are matched with those in need, direct. 100% of everything we
    do goes to helping others. There are no administrative deductions. It’s a new
    model for charitable giving. \r\n \r\nWe need help and resources to continue on
    this amazing journey which is the reason we are approaching you. By joining with
    us we believe you can have a large beneficial effect on what we are doing. Where
    we think this could be a good fit with you, is perhaps under Sustainability (People,
    Planet, Profit) and also Corporate Social Responsibility.\r\n\r\nHow can you help?
    Well first and foremost we would simply like to come and chat and share with you
    what we are doing in greater detail. We think it will be an interesting meeting!
    \r\n\r\nOther key partners we are currently in discussion with for support in
    other ways include; Barclays, Northern Trust, Virgin Media, Reading Borough Council,
    Reigate and Banstead Borough Council, First Capital Connect, Eversheds Solicitors
    and Oracle.\r\nMany Organisations’ employees are already contributing in various
    ways and they are themselves now “Being the Difference”.\r\n\r\nBeing the difference
    in the lives of others is really important for sure, but what people find when
    they do this is that they also become the difference in their own lives too. By
    giving and making a contribution in this way they end up having a richer, more
    meaningful life themselves.\r\n\r\nImagine a world where we each give something
    back without any thought or regard to our own personal gain or profit. This is
    exactly what we are building. A global “giving” platform, where those in need
    are able to connect directly with those who are able to give something, however
    great or small this might be. \r\n\r\nMany thousands of people giving small amounts
    of course adds up to being a massive difference in the lives of others.\r\n\r\nIn
    building Champions Club Community we have been guided by the Margaret Mead statement;
    “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful and committed people can change
    the world, indeed it’s the only thing that ever does”.\r\n\r\nOur request is simply
    that you kindly agree to meet with us to explore whether you might be able to
    play a role in helping us build the Global Noticeboard and our extended Community.
    \r\n\r\nThank you. We look forward to hearing back from you.\r\n \r\nBest Wishes,
