    What is the plan for multi-authored articles? How come the corresponding author
    would be defined? Should each author register individually on the website, or

<p>Dear Annotum team,<br />
I recently tried your theme on Wordpress.com in order to set up an electric journal. I faced some issues may be you could help me out.</p>
<p>1- In 'New Article' panel, the icons of tools used in writing are not loaded properly, as well as reference section, etc.<br />
2- How should I add our specific sections of each article (Introduction, Results, Discussion, Case report, Conclusion, etc) while adding a new article?<br />
3- What is the plan for multi-authored articles? How come the corresponding author would be defined? Should each author register individually on the website, or is it possible for corresponding author to add their names on their behalf?<br />
4- How can I export XMLs?<br />
5- How to add PDF for each article?</p>
<p>These for now :)<br />
Sorry for my long series of questions.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />
Sina<br />
