    sir/madam\r\n\r\nMy name is Thomas King, from the Scholarly Communication in Africa

    Annotum, but have been unable to communicate since then. \r\n\r\nI understand
    this is a very busy time for you, as well as the general end-of-year winding down
    (happens to us all!) but we are really keen to make contact and discuss the possible
    uses of Annotum for our programme.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me when you would be most
    available to do a more in-depth question-answer session. From what we've seen,
    Annotum promises to be a very exciting and powerful tool, and we would love to
    be involved as an early adopter.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n- Thomas King\r\n\r\n-
