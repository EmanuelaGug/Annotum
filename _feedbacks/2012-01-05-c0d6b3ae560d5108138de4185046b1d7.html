<p>I've started working with Annotum 1.01 theme. I managed to transfer my knols to my WP site. However, when I started editing articles I could not make them visible in a final view. In other words, I successfully found and inserted a needed image while I did insertion it in the visual editor. After the article was saved I tried to view a result but the image was not seen. I've no idea what happened.</p>
<p>See, for instance, .</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
