    news is that I'd be able to offer my services at no cost; I work on behalf of

    a related way, of course) anything I send over would be yours to publish it as
    you see fit and would not be used on other blogs or sites. If you don’t have something
    specific in mind I'm happy to spend some time on your site understanding your

    do let me know and I'll send something over which would be useful. The offer is
    also open to any other sites you might own as well as annotum.wordpress.com, but
