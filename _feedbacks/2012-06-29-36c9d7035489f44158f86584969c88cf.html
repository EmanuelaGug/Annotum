    - I manage a listserve to whom I send out a monthly summary of annotated research
    in a specific field.  The people on the listserve have asked me to set up something
    so they can search the back issues.  I would like to set up a simple website with
    an archive of issues that are searchable, and since these are all Pubmed citations,
    it would probably be nice after the search if they could be downloadable somehow
    in a structured way to people's databases.  Is annotum a way I can do that?  Also,
    since I haven't used wordpress before and minimally know what I am doing, can
    you recommend a company to guide me?  I want to manage the site myself, but probably
    need help getting it set up to do the above.  Thanks very much.\r\n\";}"
