<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm using your great theme for a news media site.  I'm trying to remove older articles from the carousel by unselecting them as "Featured" in the editor.  However, when I unselect "Featured" and save the article, the checkbox becomes selected again.  It looks like there's no way to get published articles off the carousel without deleting and rebuilding them.  Let me know if there's a trick to it?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
