    \ I'm looking into moving our law journal online and using wordpress / annotum
    to host it.  Can you give me examples of other law journals or law reviews that
    use annotum.  The only one I found that mentioned annotum on their site seems
    to be out of date:\r\nIndiana Journal of Constitutional Law (uses annotum but
    not current) http://nalsarijcl.in/ \r\n\r\nI found a few others that use wordpress
    but can't tell if they use annotum \r\nGeorge Mason Journal of International Commercial
    Law is powered by wordpress http://www.georgemasonjicl.org/ \r\n   \r\nGood  EXAMPLE
    - Harvard Journal on Sports and Entertainment Law is powered by wordpress http://harvardjsel.com/current-issue/volume-4-2/
