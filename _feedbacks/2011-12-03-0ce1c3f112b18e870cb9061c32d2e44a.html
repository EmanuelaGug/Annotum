<p>I just found and read all about Annotum<br />
I think it has TREMENDOUS potential for allowing me to organize my laboratory publications<br />
It is an ideal internal writing tool to write and correct articles together, however, once we are done I would like to export the article and send it for submission to a peer-reviewed journal<br />
Are there any tools to allow us to do that?<br />
And if not, would you consider incorporating those tools/capabilities into the system?<br />
Yes ideally everyone would publish their own work but think of Annotum as a tool that will allow people coordinate the writing of articles/reports on-line and then publish them in another way<br />
Thanks<br />
