    - I have a very quick question:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI like the \"open source\"
    collaborative nature of both Word Press and Annotum. I am interested in using
    Annotum to collaboratively author a [e-]book. However, prior to authoring the
    [e-]book, I would like to 'mind-map' it in order to establish the structure, layout,
    content and flow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1? Is Annotom the right tool with which to
    author a [e-]book? I see that it has the ability to print and generate PDF and
    XML content. How easy would it be to convert the content to epub format by way
    of example?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2? Is there a 'mind-map' plug-in available for
    Annotum that we can subsequently refer to directly in order to develop the [e-]book's
    content? What I mean by this is if I map out the [e-]book with a 'mind-map' tool,
    can I then follow on with the text ('flesh') which will subsequently yield the
    end product?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI guess what I'm looking for is a mind-mapping
    tool that comes with |or| is seamlessly integrated with an authoring tool. <br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you in advance,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAttila Horvath<br />\r\nMaryland<br
