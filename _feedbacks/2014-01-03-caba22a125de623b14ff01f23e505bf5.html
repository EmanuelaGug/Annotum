    Hello!\r\n\r\nUsing the annotum sans theme, I'm trying to have posts featured
    in the carousel instead of articles (presumably the same way that PLOS|Currents
    has their carousel set up). However, as a novice coder, I'm a bit lost as to how
    I can accomplish this.\r\n\r\nSo far I've deduced that one approach may be to
    attribute the 'anno_featured' tag to posts instead of articles. Alternately, I've
    been trying to modify the query parameters in featured-articles.php to include
    all posts. Unfortunately, neither of these have worked for me. Perhaps I could
    get a little advice?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time! I'll be certain to share
    my site when it's completed!\nSubject: How to feature posts instead of articles
    in carousel?\nWhere is your Annotum Site Hosted?: Self-hosted (WordPress.org)\n\nTime:
