    />\n<b>Comment:</b> Hi!<br />\r\nI am working on a project with some other members
    from a lab at Stanford University. The goal of our project is to create a searchable
    online annotated bibliography that focuses on mental health research related to
    Muslim communities. We hope to eventually progress to a comprehensive searchable
    database. I actually do not have any experience at all with IT or programming
    in any capacity. I was hoping that you could provide any information regarding
    the features of Annotum and if it might be helpful for us to look into so that
    maybe we can start our database through this software? If you would like more
    information regarding our project, please let me know! We are still in the initial
    phases so that is why I am contacting you. We hope to find something to get us
    started with the bibliography.<br />\r\nThank you,<br />\r\nRaza Tariq<br /><br
