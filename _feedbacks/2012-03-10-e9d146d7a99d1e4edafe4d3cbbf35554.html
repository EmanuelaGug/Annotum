Looked under know and annotup.  I found nothing, zero zilch.  I was looking for exmples to see if I could make suggestions, review, maybe even write one fo these silly articals.  But looking for TCP/IP, Internet, Cow, Cow Magenets, and even UDP  (I would tell you this UDP joke but I am not sure you would get it) and neither KNOL, or Annotum has any content.  So you launched a site with no content hoping people would write somethign but you didn't even provide even a default example.<br />
