    there,\r\n\r\nWe're very interested in the Annotum project, and think this a very
    good candidate platform for a new series of journals we're planning. \r\n\r\nAs
    such we're going to install and mess around with the alpha, and will happily pass
    back testing feedback. Is this currently done via the google list, or should we
    use another mechanism?\r\n\r\nAnother question - are you able to share a development
    timeline, with beta and initial release targets?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nBrian\r\nUbiquity
    Press\";}"
