    nice to meet you virtually. I was excited to learn about the Annotum initiative,
    as I strongly feel that there is a need for an high-quality, online authoring

    I wanted to point you to MathJax, a project that I am working on and that I think
    will be of interest to Annotum. In a nutshell, MathJax is a new open source technology
    that renders mathematics on the web. Initiated by the American Mathematical Society,
    SIAM, and Design Science, it is rapidly becoming a new standard for high-quality
    display in HTML. It is already used by several leading scholarly publishers such
    as Project Euclid at Cornell, the Optical Society, and Elsevier for its Article
    of the Future project (more examples, and links, are available at  http://www.mathjax.org/community/mathjax-in-use).\r\n\r\nMathJax
    is very easy to use for both authors and readers. It works with MathML (the W3C
    XML-based data standard for mathematics), and can be easily used from within WordPress
    by calling to the public CDN Service - no need to install any files or plug-ins.\r\n\r\nI
    thought that you might be interested in this technology, and hope that you will
    take a closer look at mathjax.org. Please feel free to contact me should you have
    any further question or would like to discuss things in some more detail.\r\n\r\nThanks,
