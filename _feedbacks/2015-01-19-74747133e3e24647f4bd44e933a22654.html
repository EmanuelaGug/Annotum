    to the university site (using Annotum 1.1.1), and have lost almost all functionality
    of Annotum. Under New Article, the body section opens with HTML code above the
    button line, paragraphs do not work, references do not appear in the body, and
    when published, the author and the upper line for print and comment is exceptionally
    large.\r\n\r\nCan we make Annotum 1.1.1 work with Wordpress 3.4.1? Is it Wordpress?
    Is it the university? If we host it elsewhere, will it work? \r\n\r\nWe loved
    Annotum when we started using it a few years ago, but since Wordpress updated,
    our functionality declined. We use Annotum for an academic newsletter with five
    different college classes, so we really need to have the ability to include pictures,
    references, and comments. \r\n\r\nThanks for your help\nSubject: Annotum Functions
