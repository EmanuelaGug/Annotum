    INVITATION\r\n \r\nDear colleague,\r\n \r\nWe've noticed your contributions to
    the debate on scientific publishing. We would therefore like to invite you to
    consider a contribution to a Special Topic entitled “Beyond open access: visions
    for open evaluation of scientific papers by post-publication peer review”, which
    we are editing for Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience.\r\n \r\nA scientific
    publication system needs to provide two basic services: access and evaluation.
    \r\nOpen access is now widely accepted as desirable and is slowly beginning to
    become a reality. However, the second essential element, open evaluation, has
    received less attention. This Special Topic in Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience
    will therefore collect visions for a future system of open evaluation.\r\n \r\nWe
    believe that this topic requires transdisciplinary expertise and the cognitive,
    computational, and brain sciences are best prepared to take on this task, which
    will involve social and psychological considerations, software design, and modeling
    of the networks of scientific papers and authors and their interrelationships.\r\n
    \r\n \r\nA Frontiers’ Special Topic features the latest advances and challenges
    in hot research areas. It is a collection of at least ten articles, which may
    be comprised of any one of Frontiers’ article types. To participate, we would
    first need an abstract for your paper.\r\n \r\nThe detailed focus of this Special
    Topic is described at the end of this email.\r\n \r\n \r\nFor more information,
