<p>I got my first article with a lot of images and illustrations.  They did not paste in from word and when I tried to insert them using the image button, I could only get them to med size, which due to the detailed nature of the illustrations just didn't do the trick.  They were not automatically linked to the original like I am used to in Wordpress either.</p>
<p>Is there a way to get full sized images into an article.  And what is the difference between a figure and inline.<br />
