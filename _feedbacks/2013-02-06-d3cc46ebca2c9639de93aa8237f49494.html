<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm hoping to use Annotum as the platform for a small magazine. Unfortunately, my magazine requires certain functionality that is absent from Annotum--namely, journal issues (each with their own metadata), and an authoring system based on something other than users (e.g., a taxonomy). Would it be possible for me to build onto Annotum (through custom post types, fields and meta boxes), to add this sort of functionality? Are there any guides to doing so? I'm hoping to create a simple standalone plugin to add this, but I'm not sure how feasible or advisable it is to do so.</p>
<p>Also, is it possible (that is, fairly easy) to transport the functionality of Annotum to a new theme? Or am I better off creating a child theme? Thanks.<br />
