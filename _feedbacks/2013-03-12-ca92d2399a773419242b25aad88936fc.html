<p>Hi,<br />
I am an MBA student at MIT. I have been working on a system that brings together scholarly material and collective intelligence of the crowd. I feel Annotum is ideally positioned to evolve into that ambitious system. I am motivated enough to make it my life's mission, to change the way knowledge is created and used in the world. It will be my privilege to have the opportunity to do so with Annotum.org and Google.<br />
I eagerly look forward to hearing from you. </p>
<p>Sincerely<br />

I am an MBA student at MIT. I have been working on a system that brings together scholarly material and collective intelligence of the crowd. I feel Annotum is ideally positioned to evolve into that ambitious system. I am motivated enough to make it my life's mission, to change the way knowledge is created and used in the world. It will be my privilege to have the opportunity to do so with Annotum.org and Google.<br />
I eagerly look forward to hearing from you. </p>
