    clean looks with its customizable color. Great job!\r\nHowever, I am now experiencing
    some difficulties in installing the latest version (1.02). I've downloaded the
    .zip file from github, but then what should I do? Should I delete the old annotum-base
    folder on my hosting server and then upload the new one? But if I do so, will
    I lose all my articles, comments, links, etc? I'll be really glad hearing your
    response. Thanks!\";}"
