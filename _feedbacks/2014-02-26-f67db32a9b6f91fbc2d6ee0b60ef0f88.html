    Good day!\r\n\r\nThe reason for my email is that we recently helped 2 website
    publishers in a similar niche to http://annotum.org/ generate an extra $360 per
    month. I think we can help you too. \r\n\r\nWe are interested in static text link
    advertisements on your home page.  We wish to use space not being utilized (i.e.
    footer or sidebar), which does not interfere with site content or other ads. You
    have full rights to reject any links we send you for placement on your site. Maintenance
    of the links is minimal. We are flexible in terms of placement and pay out every
    30 days through Paypal.  \r\n\r\nBased on a review of your site, we would like
    to pay $30 per text link per month. Our average publishers have 12 text links
    on their site which would be an additional recurring revenue of $360 per month.\r\n\r\nYou
    can see an example of our program on one of our publishers:\r\n\r\ndrupalizing.com\r\n\r\nWe
    send out weekly campaigns to our advertisers and have one remaining slot for next
    weeks’ list. Please let me know if you’re interested in proceeding & I will get
    a contract over to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\nSharleen Escuro\r\nText
