<p>I recently activated the Annotum Base theme to www.TheEmploymentBrief.com through wordpress.com and I'm experiencing a few bugs. When I try to write an article there is no way to write the body. When the body toggles down it's simply blank with no box to type in and no cursor.</p>
<p>Also, on the home page there is a big gap below my navagation bar that doesn't appear on any of my other pages.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do to fix these errors? This theme is perfect otherwise.</p>
