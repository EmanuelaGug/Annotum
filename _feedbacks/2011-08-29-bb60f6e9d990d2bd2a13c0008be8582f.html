    Sir/Madam\r\n\r\nMy name is Thomas King, the research assistant for the Scholarly
    Communication in Africa Programme (SCAP). We are extremely interested in Annotum,
    and would love to begin talking with the administrators and developers about the
    scope of this new platform for scholarly communication and publishing.\r\n\r\nSCAP
    is an IDRC-funded programme exploring the realm of scholarly communications in
    the sub-Saharan African context, and part of the ambit of the programme is to
    explore efficient web-based platforms for Open Access Research. We understand
    that while many scholars internationally support Open Access as a theoretical
    model, wide-scale uptake of Open Access will only occur when the tools used to
    promote open research are net time savers for researchers, and must thus be user-
    and consumer-friendly, efficient and targeted to as wide a scholarly audience
    as possible.\r\n\r\nWe would love to start talking to you about the possibility
    of using Annotum in the sub-Saharan publishing arena, which has little global
    representation despite the quantity and quality of original research being produced.\r\n\r\nWe
    look forward to hearing from you soon, and would like to express our appreciation
    that your project exists and is addressing such an urgent scholarly need.\r\n\r\nYours
