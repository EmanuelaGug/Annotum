<p>Hello,<br />
I installed Annotum because I was excited to see if it really does use proper JATS XML, but the export feature only creates the usual Wordpress XML.</p>
<p>Is Annotum still being actively developed and supported? Does Solvitor and/or Crowd Favorite offer consulting (for hire) for Annotum projects?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
