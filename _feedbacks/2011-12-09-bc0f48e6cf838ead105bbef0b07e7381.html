    have noticed that titles within the body of the article render differently. On
    some articles the titles are just bold plain text, but on some articles the titles
    are italic bold and they have a neat underline towards the finish. I thought that
    this issue might be because I have copied and pasted the title from Microsoft
    Word, but I copied the italic title including the title box over to an article
    with only bold plain-text titles within it, and it was rendered as bold plain
    text.\r\n\r\nThanks.\";}"
