    Hey! I'm putting together a new website for an ezine/journal at the University
    of Oregon and we are looking at annotum for it. I was wondering if you could tell
    me your workflow, plugins, or anything else I would need to know? I have a meeting
    tomorrow with the journal editors and some of the other team members, and I'm
    hoping to talk to them about our theme so we can get to installation! \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-Cat\nSubject:
