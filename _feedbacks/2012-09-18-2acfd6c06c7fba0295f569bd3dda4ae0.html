    for some of the stuff I do)\r\n\r\nI am chairing a session provisionally entitled
    \"What's New in Online Submission Systems\" at the STM eProduction Seminar in
    London, Thursday 6 December 2012. http://www.stm-assoc.org/events/stm-e-production-seminar-2012/.
    This is a popular event with interests that actually go beyond the eProduction
    of its title. It generally gets an excellent (and international) audience because
    it takes place during the same week as London Online and is the day before the
    STM Innovations Seminar.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to follow the format successfully
    used at last year for the session \"What's New in Online Hosting\", with short
    15-minute sessions from as many of the relevant systems as possible, as well as
    a possible publisher perspective. I would be very pleased if you might be interested
    in participating to present Annotum and the progress it has made since launch
    last year. I have a few tentative ideas for the kind of topics I'd like to hear
    about myself but I'm very open to all suggestions. If you are potentially interested
    in participating we could discuss further – perhaps easiest if we set up a call,
    or we can exchange email if you prefer?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n -Mark\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDirector
