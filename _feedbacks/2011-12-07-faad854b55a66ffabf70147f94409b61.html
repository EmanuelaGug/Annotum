<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I made a few mathematical Knols, and now Knol is (really sadly) being shutdown, I exported them to Annotum.<br />
But, as you can see here http://stevenrooseknol.wordpress.com/article/oplossen-van-differentiaalvergelijkingen-3vtjkywjm9myu-16/ the equations I made with the knol equation editor do not show up.<br />
I already forwarded all my knol traffic to Annotum, so I'd like to have the equations working as soon as possible.<br />
The knol is meant to help students in my university with solving differential equations and the exam season is coming so they will really need the article!<br />
(That was why I like Knol so much, for it's reliability, I don't understand why Google shuts it down and disappoints so many content creators)</p>
<p>Is it possible to get the Knol Equation images working??</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>
