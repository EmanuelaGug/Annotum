<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am a college student and for our web design class we are using annotum base for the final project. Do you know what is the best way to modify the annotum base theme? </p>
<p>So far I have created a new folder called annotum-base-child and I have a style.css. What should I put into the description and how should I import the parent stylesheet?</p>
<p>In the wordpress editor a note says "@package anno<br />
 * This file is required by WordPress to read theme info. Actual styles loaded from assets dir" but I don't know where this is.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help<br />
