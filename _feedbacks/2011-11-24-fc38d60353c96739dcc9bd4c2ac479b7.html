<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Where can I find some info on how to use Annotum's Appendix? Also, is it possible to use Annotum for book publishing? For example is there a way to mark some Annotum's articles as a book's chapters, to create table of contents and back index?</p>
<p>And, finally, is it possible to have some kind of corrections an author would be able to approve or reject?
