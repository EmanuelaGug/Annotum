<p>Hello</p>
<p>I have just discovered annotum. I am a professor who recently joined a Thai university and I already run an academic journal. I have just downloaded the latest version of the annotum theme and installed it on WP3.1.3.</p>
<p>I understand that the system is not fully developed yet but there are some things which do not seem to be operational and I wonder if I am doing something wrong or if it simply is not ready yet.</p>
<p>Here are three things I am concerned about:</p>
<p>(a) It is not clear how one can upload and format articles other than in fckeditor.</p>
<p>(b) While workflow is turned on, I cannot see the workflow sequencing for articles submitted for publication.</p>
<p>(c) The PDF/XML/email etc... functions do not seem to work at this stage</p>
<p>(d) It is not clear how/where information re address of contributors etc is held and displayed (in the usual academic format at the top of articles).</p>
<p>I am wondering about these partly because I am not familiar with wordpress and, as I said, wondering what I am doing wrong.</p>
<p>I really like what I have seen so far and look forward to monitoring and eventually using Annotum.</p>
<p>best wishes<br />
