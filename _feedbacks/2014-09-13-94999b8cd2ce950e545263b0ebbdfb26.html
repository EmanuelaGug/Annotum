<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am testing out Annotum for the first time to decide if I want to continue using it.  So far I really love the theme but my posts aren't showing on the blog page. Is there something I'm missing in the configuration or is this a technical issue with the new wordpress?</p>
<p> I'm running Wordpress 4.0 on a self hosted site.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br />
