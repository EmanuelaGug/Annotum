    team and I are publishing the first Issue of the Journal of Sport for Development
    on Annotum 1.0 (we've had the site up and running for some time but only now have
    articles ready to publish). We have a separate system that we use for manuscript
    submission and review - we just use Annotum for publishing. We're struggling in
    the final stages to get things clean and correct.\r\n\r\n- Because our authors
    are not Authors in Wordpress and we didn't want to make them become wordpress
    members, we've bypassed the way Annotum handles authors and used our own convention
    within the body of the article.\r\n- As a result, we have to put the Abstract
    in the body as well, since we want authors to come first.\r\n- This creates problems
    for the homepage carousel (it shows the author information when we'd rather have
    it show part of the abstract.\r\n- We could put content into the abstract, but
    then that comes up on top of the authors, creating more problems. We can't hide
    the abstract section on the article using CSS because there isn't a dedicated
    abstract class.\r\n- We tried creating placeholder articles (perhaps this is what's
    meant by \"stubs\" as suggested in the forum?) that link to the Article page and
    do have an abstract that fits in the carousel, but the main problem with this
    is that we then get duplicate Articles in the list of Recent Articles on the homepage
    (see www.jsfd.org/volumes for our placeholder homepage).\r\n\r\nI'm busy trying
    to find a clean work-around. I'd like to be able to use the homepage template,
    but it's looking right now like the only way around might be to just set up our
