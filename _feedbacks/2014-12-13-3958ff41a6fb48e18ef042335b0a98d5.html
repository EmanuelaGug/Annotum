    Hi,\r\nWe have started using Annotum for publishing our journal.\r\nHowever, almost
    authors complaint on how difficult it is to submit manuscript following the \"New
    Article\" tab. They need to adapt almost every line and sections. Validation usually
    find errors difficult to solve and so on. Tables are imposible to paste and need
    to be created from scratch.\r\nIs there any way to ease the submission of manuscripts?
    At least if we could avoid the validation issues we´d have a more fluent system,
    because otherwise we´ll be unable to keep using Annotum. Otherwise we love it,
    so we´d like to keep using it. All we need is a simpler way of submitting manuscripts.\r\nThank
