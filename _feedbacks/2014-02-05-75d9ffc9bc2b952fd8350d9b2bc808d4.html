    Hello,\r\nI recently received notice from Google that my website has been assessed
    a penalty after they \"detected unnatural links\" pointing from your website to
    mine: http://getasword.com/. While we appreciate the link(s), in today's Google
    climate they can now actually harm rankings. \r\n\r\nWe ask that you please remove
    the links to our site from the following URL(s) or at least add Nofollow attribute
    to them:\r\nhttp://conservativecaucas.org/the-lost-secret-regarding-sword-store/\r\nhttp://conservativecaucas.org/japan-footprint-any-family-tree/\r\n\r\nWe
    wanted to contact you first because our only other option is to file a \"Disavow
    Link\" report with Google. If we do this, it may adversely affect your site's
    Google rankings and wanted to give you a heads-up first.\r\n\r\nIf you have any
    questions or need any assistance, we'd be glad to point you in the right direction
    to make this process easier for you!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJames\r\nFounder
