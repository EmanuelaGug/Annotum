    Dec I helped someone set up this up this site - she was just looking for a basic

    she liked the look of it  - she wanted something very plain, and the color was
    right. So I set it up\r\n\r\nProblems -\r\nEditing the articles - I've done a
    little more research and read that the regular wordpress editor is turned off
    - I turned off visual editing, and she can enter the html - but that's not going
    to be a good long term solution -is there a way to get the regular wordpress editor
    back.\r\n\r\nAlso - don't like the  [...] at the end of the posts and would like
    to see a readmore link\r\n\r\nBottom line - I'm wondering if annotum is appropriate
    for a regular old wordpress blog, or if I need to change the template before getting
    too far into this - she's happy with how it looks - just now how it works \r\nWe
    don't care about scholarly articles and whatever that requires\r\n\r\nThanks\";}"
