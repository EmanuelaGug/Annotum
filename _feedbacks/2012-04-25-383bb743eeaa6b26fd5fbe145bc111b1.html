    came across your blog a few weeks ago as I was researching and writing my most
    recent series of publications, which collectively form a set of educational resources
    for people looking to pursue distance learning they come together at onlineschools.org.
    These resources include the Education Debate http://www.onlineschools.org/education-debate/,
    multiple different resources on the practicality of certain fields, and even an
    eBook.\r\n\r\nTogether, some of these have been referenced by the likes of the
    New York Times, PBS, and Mashable, among others.\r\n\r\nI think a blog post that
    discusses educational reform, the current state of learning, and where it seems
    to all be headed into the future could be a valuable and insightful piece for
    your readers. If you're interested, I would really love to work with you and come

    enjoy. What do you think?\r\n\r\nIt would be such a pleasure to hear from you.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nEstelle
