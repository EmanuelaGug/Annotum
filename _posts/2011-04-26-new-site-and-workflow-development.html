<p>Welcome to the new Annotum site!  Feel free to explore the information here, and don't forget to follow us on Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/annotum">@annotum</a>) or subscribe to site updates using the button on the right.  I'll soon be deprecating the old info.annotum.org for anyone who was using it (yes, both of you).</p>
<p>We're just starting development this week, working through the intricacies of workflow and permissions.  The workflow model is fairly simple, with just a few actions (and the resulting state in parentheses)</p>
<ol>
<li>Create  (state: draft)</li>
<li>Submit (state: in review)</li>
<li>Accept/revise/reject (state: accepted | draft | rejected)</li>
<li>Publish</li>
</ol>
<p>However, once you add the other actions, from adding reviewers and coauthors to comments and ratings, the picture looks a little more like this:</p>

<p>Coming up next week: setting up the staging server and populating the code repository with our initial commit.  Stay tuned!</p>
