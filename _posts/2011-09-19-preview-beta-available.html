<p>For a few weeks now, we've been putting out (via <a href="http://twitter.com/annotum" title="@annotum">@annotum</a> on Twitter) links to a preview version of the Annotum Beta. We've decided to add a post here as well for those of you who don't follow the Twitter stream.  Please note that this preview release is for the more technically-minded and is not suitable for production use.  Please have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Annotum/Annotum/wiki/Preview-Version-Release-Notes" title="release notes">release notes</a> before you get started.</p>
<p>Here's the latest tweet for your linking and downloading pleasure:</p>
<p><code>New preview: New DOI and PubMed lookup, Better XML. <a href="http://t.co/FwsuQfEF">http://t.co/FwsuQfEF</a> Theme <a href="http://t.co/LEYr8Gn9">http://t.co/LEYr8Gn9</a> Full App Readme: <a href="http://t.co/sfZKWC4D">http://t.co/sfZKWC4D</a></code></p>
<p>Translation: There's a new preview available today with enhanced CrossRef DOI and PubMed ID lookups and better XML output than in previous releases.  You can download the "full app" (basically a complete, stand-alone version of WordPress and Annotum [Windows only]) from <a href="http://t.co/LEYr8Gn9">http://t.co/LEYr8Gn9</a> or just the theme code from <a href="http://t.co/FwsuQfEF">http://t.co/FwsuQfEF</a>.  </p>
<p>Please note that while some features such as the table and image insertion have been enhanced, some other features are still on the to-do list, from equations to WXR/XML import and PDF output. As always feedback is welcome either via this site or via the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/annotum">Annotum discussion list</a>.</p>
<p>Happy previewing,</p>
<p>-The Annotum Team </p>
