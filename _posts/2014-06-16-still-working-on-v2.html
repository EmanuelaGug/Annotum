<p>Here's a very quick update on the progress toward fixes for Annotum 2.0 and WP 3.9+ compatibility.  We are making solid progress, as you can see from the growing lists of <a href="https://github.com/Annotum/Annotum/issues?page=1&state=closed">closed issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Annotum/Annotum/commits/textorum-integration">commits</a>, but the downloadable version of Annotum 2.0 is still a couple of weeks away at best, and the update for the WordPress.org theme repository will follow sometime after that.</p>
<p>The current workaround is to downgrade WordPress to 3.8 or lower, but we realize this may not be a viable option for everyone.  Thanks very much for your continued understanding and patience.</p>
