<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-121" title="logo-a-alpha" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/logo-a-alpha1.png" alt="" width="81" height="104" />We're pleased to announce the release of the alpha version of Annotum.  This initial release provides collaborative authoring and editorial review/workflow features in addition to standard WordPress functions such as pages, posts, and the like.  Some planned functionality, in particular the creation, import, and export of structured XML and an enhanced article editor, is not available in this release.</p>
<p>As with any early software version, Annotum Alpha is not suitable for production systems as bugs both known and unknown may lurk within it.  Still, give it a try and let us know what you think!</p>
