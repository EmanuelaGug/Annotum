<p>Attention knol users!  The knol sunset is coming in just a few days.  That means</p>
<blockquote><p>After May 1, you will no longer be able to create, view, enter or edit knols, but you will be able to export your knols to WordPress.com and download them to file through October 1st, 2012.</p></blockquote>
<p>You still have time to <a href="https://en.wordpress.com/signup?knol=true">migrate your knols to WordPress.com</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/takeout#custom:knol">export your knols to a file</a> that you can use to import into a self-hosted WordPress site.  You can also <a href="http://annotum.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/40442">follow these instructions</a> if you want to export your knols to other services such as Blogger. </p>
<p>If you go the self-hosted Annotum route, be sure to use the <a href="https://github.com/Annotum/Annotum/downloads">latest version of the theme</a> from Github; the version available on WordPress.org is the original 1.0 version, which does not have the <a href="https://github.com/Annotum/Annotum/wiki/Annotum-release-notes-v1.02">latest fixes and enhancements</a>.  These fixes will be released on both WordPress.org and WordPress.com in the coming weeks, but in the meantime we encourage you to upgrade to the latest GitHub version.</p>
<p>As always, please feel free to use any of the Annotum <a href="http://annotum.org/support/" title="Support">support options</a> to get help with your migration, setup, or use of Annotum.</p>
