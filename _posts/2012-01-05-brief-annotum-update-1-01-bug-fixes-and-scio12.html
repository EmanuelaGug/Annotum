<p>Firstly, allow me to wish a very Happy New Year to everyone reading this.  The response to the launch of Annotum v1.0 has been very enthusiastic, and a number of you have launched journals and other sites based on your Knol content.  Some others are in the process of setting up new journals -- all of which is very exciting.</p>
<p>Just before the holidays, we made a fair bit of progress in <a title="Closed Github Issues List" href="https://github.com/Annotum/Annotum/issues?sort=updated&amp;direction=desc&amp;state=closed&amp;page=1">squashing</a> some of the initial bugs that were found in Annotum v1.0, and those changes have all been deployed to a new <a href="https://github.com/Annotum/Annotum/tree/1.01-Fixes">branch on GitHub</a>.  For the next couple of weeks we'll be continuing to implement the last fixes for what will become v1.01.  Once fully tested, we'll update the <a href="https://github.com/Annotum/Annotum/downloads">downloads on GitHub</a> and update the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/annotum-base">main theme code on WordPress.org</a>. Of course, if you can't wait, you can always grab the latest branch code as a <a href="https://github.com/Annotum/Annotum/zipball/1.01-Fixes">zip download</a>.</p>
<p>We hope to release v1.01 prior to <a href="http://scienceonline2012.com/">ScienceOnline 2012</a> later this month, where I'll be presenting an <a href="http://scio12.wikispaces.com/Blitz+talks">Annotum Demo</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please feel free to use the <a title="Support" href="http://annotum.org/support/">support page</a> to seek help, refer to the <a href="https://annotum.uservoice.com/knowledgebase">knowledge base</a> for tutorials and answers, and <a title="Contact" href="http://annotum.org/contact/">contact us</a> if you need help setting up a customized Annotum site or have any other questions not covered by the above.</p>
