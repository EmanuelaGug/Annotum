<h2><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:15px;">Introduction and Background</span></h2>
<p>Despite significant advances in most forms of publishing, from blogs to news sites and other user-generated web content, the process of authoring scholarly articles remains an expensive, time-consuming process that can require significant up-front investment and technical expertise. While a number of electronic publishing and workflow management systems exist, those intended for the scientific publishing (SP) community provide at best only rudimentary authoring tools – and in many cases simply provide a repository for document files created in other formats. It is as if the entire revolution in online, web-based content authoring tools has passed by the SP community. And despite the development of advanced document formats such as the National Library of Medicine’s (NLM) <a title="NLM Publishing Tag Set" href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing" target="_blank">journal article publishing tag set</a>, virtually no current system allows scientific authors to easily create structured XML documents  using simple web-based tools.</p>
<h3>Project Objectives</h3>
<ol>
<li>Develop a simple, robust, easy-to-use authoring system to create and edit scholarly articles</li>
<li>Deliver an editorial review and publishing system that can be used to submit, review, and publish scholarly articles</li>
</ol>
<h3>Project Approach</h3>
<p>Modern platforms such as WordPress provide a model for a successful eJournal authoring platform – WordPress is extremely simple to set up and run, with rich, user-friendly web-based editing controls and easily-extended functionality using plugins. The WordPress platform not only provides free and open access to source code, with a diverse and productive 'ecosystem' of developers for themes, plugins, and extensions, but also numerous cheap or free hosting opportunities for technical and non-technical users alike.</p>
<p>However, WordPress is missing some key SP requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple authors, article review workflow, and version comparison</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Scholarly features such as citations, equations, and controlled document structure (headings, lists of figures/equations/tables)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Export to and import from the NLM/PubMed Journal Article DTD and other structured formats</li>
</ul>
<div>Annotum will build upon the WordPress platform as a foundation, filling in the gaps by providing the following additional features:</div>
<ul>
<li>Rich, web-based authoring and editing:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>“What you see is what you get” (WYSIWYG) authoring with rich toolset (equations, figures, tables, citations and references)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>coauthoring, comments, version tracking, and revision comparisons</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Strict conformance to a subset of the NLM  <a title="NLM Publishing Tag Set" href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing" target="_blank">journal article publishing tag set</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Multiple import and export formats</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Export to PDF and XML formats</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Import XML and WXR formats for “round-tripping” of content</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Articles can be cited, exported, imported across systems/sites</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Simple editorial workflow for authoring and reviewer/editor approval</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Features specific to scholarly publishing:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Equations, figures, tables</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>References including citation search features</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Auto-generation and registration of CrossRef DOIs</li>
</ul>
</ul>
