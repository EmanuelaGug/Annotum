<h2>Annotum is Live!</h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce the release of Annotum version 1.0 as a hosted theme on WordPress.com, a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/annotum-base">free theme</a> on WordPress.org, and a freely available download on <a href="http://github.com/Annotum/Annotum">GitHub</a> (forks welcome).</p>
<p>I could write a long post about the many months of hard work by many people at Google, PLoS, NLM, Automattic, and particularly Crowd Favorite, all of whom deserve, and receive, my sincere thanks.</p>
<p>But instead I want you to get started using this fantastic new tool to author and publish beautiful, peer-reviewed scholarly articles and journals.</p>
<h2>Knol users: to get started, follow these steps:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <a href="http://knol.google.com">knol.google.com</a> and log in with your Google account</li>
<li>You'll see a link to "Export" or "Download" your knols.</li>
<ul>
<li>To Export your knols to WordPress.com, click the link, provide a new or existing WordPress.com username  and password, name your new journal, and follow the simple prompts. You may need to provide your knol username and password to complete the download.</li>
<li>To Download your knols, click the link and follow the prompts to export your Knol data. You'll need to set up your own WordPress installation to host Annotum, then import your Knols.</li>
<li>Note: If your knols have multiple authors, you'll need to map those authors to WordPress.com users, or you can add those users to your journal later.</li>
<li>For more information about using Annotum, please see the <a title="Support" href="http://annotum.org/support/">Annotum Support Page on Annotum.org.</a></li>
</ul>
<li>After you download or export your knols, you can to set redirects on knol.google.com for each knol to let your readers know where to find your new content.</li>
</ol>
